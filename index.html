        Kendrick have a dream. I am a sinner who's probably going to sin again.
        Playstation and some drank. Technology bought my soul. Got me breathing
        with dragons. I crack the eggs in your basket. I'm Marilyn Manson with
        madness, now just imagine the magic. Start up that Maserati and 'Vroom!
        Vroom' I'm racing. I got 25 lighters on my dresser. I can feel your
        energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music. I would
        share them both today. I can feel the changes. I can feel the people
        around me just want to be famous.

      <p>
        Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart. Play your part. On the
        oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever. Forever ever? But I know you
        wanted that 808. Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass? Ah ha, hush that fuss.
        Everybody move to the back of the bus. Do you wanna bump and slump with
        us? We the type of people that make the club get crunk. As the plot
        thickens it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles. When I met my
        SpottieOttieDopalicious angel, I can remember the damn thing like
        yesterday.
